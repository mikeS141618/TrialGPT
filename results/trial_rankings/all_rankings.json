Active approaches are directed towards diagnosis and treatment of potentially life threatening conditions, especially acute coronary syndrome and coronary artery disease. However, a considerable number of patients may have chest pain caused by biomechanical dysfunction of muscles and joints of the chest wall or the cervical and thoracic spine (20%). The diagnostic approaches and treatment options for this group of patients are scarce and there is a lack of formal clinical studies and validated outcome measures addressing the effect of manual treatment approaches.~Objective: This single blind randomized clinical trial investigates whether chiropractic treatment can reduce pain and improve function in a population of patients with acute, musculoskeletal chest pain when compared to advice directed towards promoting self-management.~Methods: Among patients admitted to a chest pain clinic in a university hospital under suspicion of acute coronary syndrome, 120 patients with an episode of acute chest pain of musculoskeletal origin are included in the study. All patients have completed the chest pain clinic diagnostic procedures, and acute coronary syndrome and other obvious reasons for chest pain have been excluded. After completion of the study evaluation program, the patients are randomized into one of two groups: A) advice promoting self-management and individual instructions focusing on posture and muscle stretch; B) a course of chiropractic therapy of up to ten treatment sessions focusing on high velocity, low amplitude manipulation of the cervical and thoracic spine together with a choice of mobilisation and soft tissue techniques. In order to establish suitable outcome measures, two pilot studies were conducted. Outcome measures are pain, function, overall health, and patient-rated treatment effect measured at 4, 12, and 52 weeks following treatment."

Among the 5.6 million patients with ACP presenting annually in emergency departments (ED) in the United States, a subgroup of two million patients is hospitalized despite normal initial cardiac biomarker tests and electrocardiogram (ECG). This subgroup is at low (20%) risk for ACS during the index hospitalization. Most (80-94%) patients with a diagnosis of ACS have a significant epicardial coronary artery stenosis ( >50% luminal narrowing). However, in -10% of patients non-stenotic coronary plaque triggers events, i.e. vasospasms, leading to myocardial ischemia. Since the absence of plaque excludes a coronary cause of chest pain, these patients could in theory be discharged earlier reducing unnecessary hospital admissions. Recent publications demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity of MDCT for the detection of significant coronary stenosis compared with coronary angiography and the detection of coronary plaque as validated with intravascular ultrasound. Using 64- slice MDCT we propose to study 400 patients with ACP, negative initial cardiac biomarkers and non-diagnostic ECG. We will analyze MDCT images for the presence of significant coronary artery stenosis and plaque and correlate the data with the clinical diagnosis of ACS (AHA guidelines) during the index hospitalization to determine the sensitivity and specificity. MDCT data, risk factors, and the results of standard diagnostic tests available at the time of MDCT will be used to generate a multivariate prediction function and derive a clinical decision rule. Based on this decision rule we will compare the diagnostic accuracies and cost effectiveness of competing strategies. We hypothesize that an MDCT- based diagnostic strategy will reduce the time to diagnosis of ACS, number of hospitalizations, and absolute cost of management of patients with acute chest pain compared to standard clinical care and is cost effective."

They are assessed by clinical history including risk factors, cardiovascular exam, resting ECG, chest x-ray, and exercise ECG. CT calcium scoring (CTCS) is a technique that is very sensitive in identifying and quantifying calcified atherosclerotic plaques. Recent guidance from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE, citation 1) proposes the use of CTCS in patients with stable chest pain who have low likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD). They recommend that patients with low likelihood (10-30%) have a CTCS and if the score is 0, they can be considered to have non-cardiac chest pain. However, there is controversy regarding relationship of absent calcification with significant CAD and its prognostic value.~At our institution, we have been performing CTCS in this patient cohort since 2003. We plan to retrospectively review the usefulness in CTCS in patients with different likelihood for significant CAD, particularly in patients with absent calcium and compare with the traditional assessment. We also plan to follow-up these patients for any myocardial infarction and death from any cause."

Although chest X-ray remains an essential step in the diagnostic process, several studies showed numerous limitations of radiography which frequently is inconclusive. Ultrasonography is a non-radiating imaging technique. Albeit a wide use of ultrasound, the utilization of ultrasound in the study of the lung has only recently been introduced in the clinical practice. Several studies proved that lung ultrasound is useful in the diagnosis of lung consolidation in community acquired pneumonia. Nowadays, ultrasound is not routinely used in the presence of chest pain. Our hypothesis based on clinical experience is that, in patients with pleuritic chest pain, lung ultrasound is very sensitive in detecting pneumonia and other lung diseases (such as pneumothorax) thus performing better than radiography. The primary aim of this study is to verify, in patients affected by pleuritic chest pain, the accuracy of lung ultrasound compared to chest-X-ray. The secondary aim is to evaluate the accuracy of lung ultrasound consolidations in distinguishing lung consolidation in pneumonia, atelectasis, pulmonary infarction, or tumors."

Invasive treatments are often indicated to prevent amputations and to alleviate symptoms. More than two thirds of these procedures are presently performed with endovascular techniques (i.e. percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, PTA with or without stent implantation).~In coronary artery disease, stents eluting anti-proliferative drugs (drug eluting stents, DES) reduce restenosis and improve clinical results for the majority of patients. Drug eluting balloons (DEB) are a promising alternative, but there is still little evidence that DES or DEB technology improve clinical outcome in PAD.

This required a functioning brain orchestrating the evaluation of the threat and choosing the response, this is a mind-mediated phenomenon. If the response is excessive it contributes to high BP, if deficient to low BP, and the BP itself will identify the allostatic pattern, which in turn will play an important role in the development of the comorbidities.~To do so, consecutive patients of any age and gender that visit a cardiologist's office in Medellin, Colombia, are recruited. Individuals are classified according to their arterial BP and allostasis and follow them in time to see what kind of diseases develops the most (including BP) in the follow up according to the categorization of the characteristic chosen and after adjustment for confounder's variables. In addition, stress events with their date are registered.~HYPOTHESIS~The causes of the diseases are multifactorial.~Physical, biochemical, psychological, social, and cultural dimensions of development dynamically interact to shape the health development process.~A person\u00b4s health depends on their:~Biological and physiologic systems~External and internal environment (a) physical, b) internal behavioural and arousal state as registered by the brain.~Their interaction.~The allostatic mechanisms to the internal and external stressors (allostatic load) involves a network composed by:~Functional systems; mediated by:~The Autonomic Nervous System~The endocrine system~The immune system~Structural changes: whenever the internal and/or external stressors are long lasting and/or strength enough, they may induce changes in:~Epigenetic, endophenotypes, polyphenism.~Plasticity~The interaction between a) and b).~The network response do not affect exclusively the BP, propitiating the development of comorbidities, which may prompt strategies for prevention, recognition and ultimately, treatment.~The allostatic model defines health as a state of responsiveness.~The concept of psycho-biotype: The allostasis is the result of both: biological (allostasis) and psychological (psychostasis) abilities. It is proposed that both components behave in similar direction and magnitude.~Immune disorders may be associated with the development of cancer. High BP population has a higher sympathetic and lower vagal tone, this has been associated with a decrease in the immune\u00b4s system function.~Resources and energy depletion: Terms like weathering have been used to describe how exposures to different allostatic loads gradually scrape away at the protective coating that keeps people healthy.

Furthermore, the pain that persists after healing of the surgical wound is a large, but often unrecognized, clinical problem and it is estimated that 5-10% of those undergoing surgery will develop severe persistent pain leading to chronic disability and psychosocial distress.~Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM), also known as the phenomenon pain-inhibits-pain, is a reduction in pain somewhere on the body in response to the application of a second painful stimulus outside the painful area. In recent years, the CPM has been identified as a psycho-physical measure with clinical relevance in characterizing the individual's ability to modulate pain and consequently the individual's disposition to acquire painful conditions.~The purpose of this study is primarily to assess the relationship between CPM efficacy and clinical postoperative pain (postoperative pain intensity, use of analgesics, the intensity of secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia, and the incidence of persistent postoperative pain) associated with minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum. In addition, the study aims at identifying other patient- and/or surgery-related factors affecting the course of postoperative pain.~Hypothesis:~- The greater the positive difference between the experimental pressure pain threshold (kPa) measured before and after application of a second painful stimulus (Cold Pressor Test), the lower the risk of developing persistent postoperative pain.~Secondary hypotheses~The greater the positive difference between the experimental pressure pain threshold (kPa) measured before and after application of a different experimental painful stimulus (Cold Pressor Test) lower the pain intensity in the early postoperative period.~The greater the positive difference between the experimental pressure pain threshold (kPa) measured before and after application of a different experimental painful stimulus (Cold Pressor Test), the shorter duration of early postoperative pain.~The greater the positive difference between the experimental pressure pain threshold (kPa) measured before and after application of a different experimental painful stimulus (Cold Pressor Test), the lower the usage of epidural analgesia (mg / ml).~The larger the positive difference between the experimental pressure pain threshold (kPa) measured before and after application of a different experimental painful stimulus (Cold Pressor Test) the lower consumption of oral analgesics (mg / day).~Severe acute pain in the early postoperative period (postoperative days 0-3) is positively associated with the development of persistent postoperative pain (6 months postoperatively).~Presence of preoperative pain and / or high postoperative use of analgesics and / or high pain intensity during the first 6-8 weeks postoperatively predicts pain 6 months postoperatively.~The higher pain intensity and discomfort associated with brush-evoked allodynia and / or pinprick (Von Frey) secondary hyperalgesia the greater the risk for developing persistent postoperative pain (6 months postoperatively).~High levels of preoperative catastrophizing (assessed on the day of admission) is related to the severity of acute pain (rated third postoperative day) and chronic pain (assessed 6 months postoperatively), even if controlled for depression and anxiety.~The degree of preoperative positive and negative emotions (as assessed on the day of admission) is related to the degree of acute pain (rated third postoperative day) and chronic pain (assessed 6 months postoperatively) so that negative emotions are associated with high levels of pain, while positive feelings are related to low levels of pain.~The study population does not differ significantly from the normal population in terms of personality traits (emotional reactions, extraversion, openness to experience, friendliness, conscientiousness).~The study population does not experience a significant change in personality traits during the first 6 months after surgery.~The quality of life and self-esteem is lower among patients who develop persistent postoperative pain compared with pain patients.~Quality of life and self-esteem improve as a result of minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum."

Although chest X-ray remains an essential step in the diagnostic process, several studies showed numerous limitations of radiography which frequently is inconclusive. Ultrasonography is a non-radiating imaging technique. Albeit a wide use of ultrasound, the utilization of ultrasound in the study of the lung has only recently been introduced in the clinical practice. Several studies proved that lung ultrasound is useful in the diagnosis of lung consolidation in community acquired pneumonia. Nowadays, ultrasound is not routinely used in the presence of chest pain. Our hypothesis based on clinical experience is that, in patients with pleuritic chest pain, lung ultrasound is very sensitive in detecting pneumonia and other lung diseases (such as pneumothorax) thus performing better than radiography. The primary aim of this study is to verify, in patients affected by pleuritic chest pain, the accuracy of lung ultrasound compared to chest-X-ray. The secondary aim is to evaluate the accuracy of lung ultrasound consolidations in distinguishing lung consolidation in pneumonia, atelectasis, pulmonary infarction, or tumors."

Blood and saliva samples will be drawn initially and after 4 hours, and baseline data assessed. All diagnostic procedures results and diagnosis made by the treating physicians as well as initiated treatment will be recorded Final diagnosis and outcome will be assessed by 2-week-telephone interview.~Measurement of candidate biomarkers will be performed in collected material. Copeptin and SAA will be measured as potential biomarkers, as a control value, cortisol will be obtained. Other biomarkers will be in consideration, depending upon availability and financial aspects.~Safety evaluations: All recommendations outlined in the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice will be adhered to throughout this trial.~Sample size considerations: The number of patients of this pilote study is based on the estimate of 25 % or 50 of acute abdomen patients to have a surgical emergency.~Significance of the study: If a biomarker is found that safely discriminates between surgical urgency and harmless abdominal pain, this will spare radiologic exposure in often young patients and will aid in optimized allocation of health care resources."

The diagnostic approaches and treatment options for this group of patients are scarce and there is a lack of formal clinical studies and validated outcome measures addressing the effect of manual treatment approaches.~Objective: This single blind randomized clinical trial investigates whether chiropractic treatment can reduce pain and improve function in a population of patients with acute, musculoskeletal chest pain when compared to advice directed towards promoting self-management.~Methods: Among patients admitted to a chest pain clinic in a university hospital under suspicion of acute coronary syndrome, 120 patients with an episode of acute chest pain of musculoskeletal origin are included in the study. All patients have completed the chest pain clinic diagnostic procedures, and acute coronary syndrome and other obvious reasons for chest pain have been excluded. After completion of the study evaluation program, the patients are randomized into one of two groups: A) advice promoting self-management and individual instructions focusing on posture and muscle stretch; B) a course of chiropractic therapy of up to ten treatment sessions focusing on high velocity, low amplitude manipulation of the cervical and thoracic spine together with a choice of mobilisation and soft tissue techniques. In order to establish suitable outcome measures, two pilot studies were conducted. Outcome measures are pain, function, overall health, and patient-rated treatment effect measured at 4, 12, and 52 weeks following treatment."
