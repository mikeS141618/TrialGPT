        "brief_summary": "Background and study hypothesis:~Many studies including prospective studies have been demonstrated that a long symptomatic prodromal phase exists prior to the onset of full-brown bipolar disorder, lasting for 9-12 years (Egeland et al., 2000). During the prodromal stage, there are three main clusters of syndromes, including hypomania/mania symptoms, depressive symptoms, and signs of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (Correll et al., 2007; Tillman et al., 2003; Mantere et al., 2008). Of the hypomania/mania symptoms, decreased sleep, elevated mood, irritability, mood lability, increased energy, and psychomotor agitation are present most frequently. The prodromal depressive symptoms are reported to be depressed mood, anhedonia, insomnia, feelings of worthlessness. Among patients with bipolar disorders, 22.5% reported to comorbid with pediatric ADHD. In addition, some symptoms are considered as non-specific such as decreased functioning, anger outburst, social isolation, and anxiety (Egeland et al., 2000).~Offspring of parents with bipolar disorders are much likely to present prodromal symptoms compared to offspring of healthy parents. In a 10-year longitudinal study using 55 prodromal symptoms checklist, , Egeland et al.(2002) found that 38% offspring of parents with bipolar disorder were considered as at risk compared to 17% in children of healthy parents. In a 15-year follow-up study, Duffy et al.,(2009) found that 32.7% offspring (aged 8-25 years old) of parents with bipolar disorder met the criteria of major mood episode.~Objectives:~One primary objective of this study is to prospectively identify the prodromal stage of bipolar disorder.~Another primary objective is to conduct a randomized, place-controlled trial of aerobic exercise on people who suffering from prodromal symptoms to the extent of significantly impaired function, with attempt at delaying or preventing the onset of a full-blown bipolar disorder.~Design of study and the procedures:~The study will consist of two phases: one-week screening period and a randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-month trial. During the screening period, offspring of parents with bipolar disorder will undergo systematically clinical evaluations. The offspring will be evaluated with clinical symptoms assessing scales, neuropsychological tests, magnetic resonance imaging. During the 3-month trial period, the offspring who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to receive treatment of aerobic exercise, placebo, or wait-list group. Psychiatrists are scheduled to assess mood, treatment outcome during the 3-month trial.~Subjects and treatment It is expected that 120 offspring of parents with bipolar disorder aged between 10-25 years, meeting the inclusion of prodromal stage, will be included in the study. All of the offspring will undertake the Kiddie Sads Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL), and a 70 checklist items of potential prodromal symptoms suggest by us as well as by Dr. Correll et al. (2007). The parents of these offspring are to have a DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)-defined bipolar disorder (bipolar I or II), confirmed by the Chinese version of Structured Clinical interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders patient edition (SCID-I/P) [First et al., 2002]. The offspring are to be recruited through the referrals by their parents who will receive psychiatric services in the Guangzhou psychiatric Hospital.~The offspring will be randomly assigned to aerobic exercise and placebo controlled groups. The aerobic exercise would include cycling, jogging,table tennis, and playing badminton for 40 mins at least 3 times a week for 3 months. In each exercise, participants are supposed to exercise to the extent of getting sweaty. In the placebo group, participants will receive general psychoeducation, including delivering knowledge on symptoms, discussion of the suffering mental difficulties, and general coping techniques.~Significance:~Bipolar disorder is a common, chronic, and recurrent mental disorder. The recognition of prodromal stage of bipolar disorder and the early intervention on it may help delay or prevent the onset of bipolar disorder."

Patients with these problems are a high-risk surgical group as they have generalized blood vessel disease. These puts them at risk of major complications around the time of surgery such as heart attacks , strokes and death. The mortality following repair of a swollen main artery in the abdomen is about 1 in 20. This contrasts poorly with the 1 per 100 risk of death following a heart bypass. Simple and cost-effective methods are needed to reduce the risks of major vascular surgery. Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) may be such a technique. To induce RIPC, the blood supply to muscle in the patient's arm is interrupted for about 5 minutes. It is then restored for a further five minutes. This cycle is repeated three more times. The blood supply is interrupted simply by inflating a blood pressure cuff to maximum pressure. This repeated brief interruption of the muscular blood supply sends signals to critical organs such as the brain and heart, which are rendered temporarily resistant to damage from reduced blood supply. Several small randomized clinical trials in patients undergoing different types of major vascular surgery have demonstrated a potential benefit. This large, multi-centre trial aims to determine whether RIPC can reduce complications in routine practice."

Older 4 clinical trials approved the efficacy of the daily dose of 200micg. It's believed that Se saturates the deficient stores of GPX so GPX saves the thyrocytes against to oxidative stresses. Although less than 70 micg/d is sufficient to maximize GPX activity, none of the authors tested the doses less than 200 micg/d. Our hypothesis was that If 100 micg/d can not suppress the TPOAb titers,it means autoimmune destruction can not be blocked by saturation of deficient stores of GPX solely and the mechanism of action requires more than repletion of deficient stores. It's important not only to estimate the optimal dose but to understand the mechanism of action. High dose therapy may also suppress TPOAb levels in Se-non-deficient AIT patients, if it is so, Se therapy may becomes the solely treatment modality which can suppress the autoimmunity in more than 400 million AIT patients. Because there've been no way to suppress autoimmune war and replacement of LT4 had been the only treatment modality for palliation. An other independent part of the study is to test the effect of Se in adolescent AIT patients."

The state of the art treatment of a symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma is to remove the hematoma by burr hole trepanation.~The optimal follow-up for operated patients remains controversial. Due to the known high rate of a second hematoma at the same place (usually within weeks), one strategy is to perform serial computer tomography scans in order to identify recurrent hematomas early. The radiologic evidence of a second hematoma often leads to reoperation, even if the patient has no, or just slight symptoms. Another strategy after surgical hematoma evacuation is to closely follow the patient with neurological examinations and perform neuroimaging only in case of new symptoms. Advocators of this strategy argue that a follow-up with routine CT scans may be harmful due to additional and maybe unnecessary surgeries and hospital days in a patient population marked by advanced age and fragility.~The aim of the current study is to evaluate the role of computer tomography scanning in the postoperative follow-up after removal of a chronic subdural hematoma. Participants of this study will be allocated by chance to one of two study groups: Patients allocated to group A will receive a computer tomography scan on day 2 and again on day 30 after surgery in addition to a clinical examination. Patients allocated to group B will be examined clinically on day 2 and day 30 without computer tomography. All patients will undergo a final clinical examination after 6 months. The study will recruit 400 patients."

Handlebar impact is now the commonest mechanism of major paediatric abdominal injury[3]. Serious handlebar injuries often occur after apparently minor falls; they are not unique to riders performing stunts[5].~One small study found that the metal handlebar ends were often exposed on bikes of children sustaining severe abdominal injuries[6]. Most European safety standards do not test grip durability[7-10]. Day-to-day use can damage rubber grips, exposing the underlying metal handlebar tube.~This feasibility study aims to test the research methods that will be used in a subsequent nationwide multicentre study. The main study will investigate the association between injuries and handlebar grip condition.~Children attending study hospitals with any bicycle or kick scooter injury will be invited to participate. Parents of injured children will be invited to complete questionnaires regarding circumstances surrounding the injury and condition of the handlebar ends on the bike or scooter involved. Clinical information regarding the injury will also be collected. The handlebar end condition will be compared between children sustaining a handlebar end injury [Cases] and riders whose injury did not involve the handlebar [Controls].~If exposed handlebar ends are more prevalent amongst riders with handlebar end injuries, injury prevention strategies can focus on methods to prevent damage occurring to grips through day-to-day use. If no such association is found, prevention strategies can be focused elsewhere, such as on design of effective protective clothing.~Data collection for this feasibility study will occur between March 2015 and September 2015.~The Chief Investigator, Mr. Andrew Neilson, funds the feasibility study."

The thresholds for the BMD estimate obtained with DI will be determined for osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic patients. For fracture risk assessment, DI measurements are used to predict the outcome of currently available fracture risk assessment tools.~To investigate optimal configuration of ultrasound parameters and patient characteristics for prediction of proximal femur and lumbar spine BMD for women in each four decades of age; 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, 70 to 79 years, and 80-89 years.~To develop national diagnostic thresholds for DI in prediction of osteoporosis status with a reference female population (American-Caucasian) in each four decades of age; 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, 70 to 79 years, and 80-89 years."

Diabetes will be defined as self-report of diabetes previously diagnosed by a physician, use of hypoglycemic medications, or fasting glucose > 126 mg/dl (7.0mM) in accordance with the American Diabetes Association criteria. The diabetic patient population will be divided into 2 groups: patients with status post low energy fractures of the proximal humerus, the proximal femur, the ankle and the foot (n=10) versus diabetic patients with no fractures or low energy trauma fracture history (n=10). An additional group of 10 diabetic postmenopausal women will be recruited and will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower back only. Caucasian, Asian and Hispanic women will be combined since a previous study suggested that BMD is very similar in these 3 population and that ethnic differences are minimal. In addition a population of 10 age-matched, BMI-matched, race-matched healthy women, without osteoporotic fractures will be examined. In all of these volunteers a medical history will be obtained to ensure good health status and rule out chronic diseases that would have an impact on bone metabolism. Patients will undergo MRI, QCT and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) examinations to determine bone mineral density and bone structure/quality.~The hypothesis of this pilot project is that type II diabetic patients with and without low-energy fractures have a different trabecular bone architecture and composition, which is also different when compared to normal age-matched healthy patients. Architectural differences in these three patient groups may be visualized with high resolution MRI and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and will be most pronounced at the calcaneus and the distal tibia. Analyzing structure parameters obtained from high resolution MRI and spectroscopy may improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetic bone disease and the prediction of fracture risk in an elderly diabetic population."

The overall goal of treatment is to reduce pain and increase blood flow to improve symptoms or save the leg and feet. In many cases, current options for treatment including medications, surgery or endovascular procedures have not been successful.~In the last few years, investigators have explored therapies aimed to increase blood flow to the ischemic vessel by transplanting cells that will promote the development of new vessels in the diseased leg.~The study hypothesis is based on the concept that the process of formation of new blood vessels is complex and requires the participation of several types of stem cells and growth factors. The lack of any of these components will produce vessels which are immature and unable to provide appropriated blood supply to the leg.~Patients eligible to participate in the this study are those suffering from double-sided claudication with poor circulation or severe leg blockages, which are not candidates for surgical procedures.~Once the mixture of stem cells is prepared and the patient's bone marrow is ready, cells will be transplanted into the calf muscle of one the the diseased legs while the other diseased leg will receive the placebo. Clinical study to evaluate and compare the efficacy of the stem cell transplant will be performed for six months post cell transplant."

Nowadays, despite the availability of good diagnostic capacities, undifferentiated febrile illnesses continue to be a thorny problem for travel physicians. In developing countries, the scarcity of skilled personnel and adequate laboratory facilities makes the differential diagnosis of fevers even more complex. Health care workers must often rely on syndrome-oriented empirical approaches to treatment and might overestimate or underestimate the likelihood of certain diseases. For instance Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) contribute substantially to the burden of persistent (more than 1 week) fevers in the Tropics, causing considerable mortality and major disability. These diseases are however rarely diagnosed at primary health care (PHC) level. The difficulty in establishing the cause of febrile illnesses has resulted in omission or delays in treatment, irrational prescriptions with polytherapy, increasing cost and development of drug resistance.~In resource-limited settings, clinical algorithms constitute a valuable aid to health workers, as they facilitate the therapeutic decision in the absence of good laboratory capacities. There is a critical lack of appropriate diagnostic tools to guide treatment of NTDs. While clinical algorithms have been developed for some NTDs, in most cases they remain empirical. Besides, they rarely take into account local prevalence data, do not adequately represent the spectrum of patients and differential diagnosis at the primary care level and often have not been properly validated. The purpose of the study is to develop evidence-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)-supported diagnostic guidelines for patients with persistent fever (\u2265 1 week) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan, Cambodia and Nepal."

Patients with stroke routinely undergo 24 hours of continuous cardiac telemetry during hospitalization for stroke as a means of excluding AF. Small studies indicate that extending the duration of monitoring with portable outpatient telemetry devices detects more cases of AF. However, these studies are small and lack control groups, and cannot demonstrate that prolonged cardiac monitoring detects more cases of AF than routine clinical follow-up. The investigators therefore propose a pilot study to determine the feasibility of randomizing patients to prolonged cardiac monitoring or routine clinical follow-up. The investigators will enroll 40 consecutive adult patients seen at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) Neurovascular service with cryptogenic stroke or high-risk TIA (ABCD2 score 4 or greater). Enrolled patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion. Group A will be assigned to wear an ambulatory cardiac event monitor for 21 days. Group B will be discharged home without a monitor and will serve as controls during routine clinical follow-up. The investigators' primary outcome will be feasibility, defined as more than 80% of randomized patients completing full clinical follow-up and more than 70% of cardiac monitoring if applicable. The investigators' secondary outcomes will be diagnoses of AF at 90 days and 1 year and diagnoses of recurrent stroke at 1 year."

        "brief_summary": "Background:~COPD is an inflammatory and chronic obstructive lung disease, mainly caused by smoking. Most patients with COPD are discovered and treated in primary health care. Co-morbidity with heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis and underweight is common. It is important to diagnose COPD at an early stage, primarily to motivate smoking cessation, which is the most important factor for decelerating the progress of COPD. In addition, medication and rehabilitation to reduce symptoms of COPD can be given. Previous studies in Sweden have shown poor quality of primary health care provided to patients with COPD.~As general practitioners often deal with multiple medical problems and patients' motivation when diagnosing and treating COPD we hypothesize that case method education (see description under intervention) in COPD has better effect than traditional education (see description under intervention).This study aims to examine the effect of case method education on (1) learning in COPD among general practitioners and on (2) health in their patients with COPD.~Method:~Primary health care centers (PHCC) in Stockholm will be recruited. The PHCCs will be randomized to either case method education (n=9 PHCCs) or traditional education (n=9 PHCCs) in COPD for their general practitioners. The educations will be held during two times (two hours each) within a time range of three months, covering examination and treatment of patients with COPD. At least 10.000 patients should be listed at PHCCs included. Random sampling of 45 patients with COPD at stage 2-3 will be done from each PHCC. The patients will fill in a self-assessment questionnaire including CCQ, CAT and LINQ (see outcome measures) as well as questions about medication, exacerbations and other chronic diseases. The questionnaire will be sent to the patients 1-2 months before the education and 18 months after the education. Differences in assessments in the questionnaire before and after the education will be compared between the patients listed at the PHCCs that have received case method education vs. traditional education. In addition, general practitioners (approximately, n=180) at the PHCCs will fill in a questionnaire, immediately before and 12 months after the education, covering the learning outcomes in order to study differences in learning between the two intervention groups."

Patients with C. difficile associated disease (CDAD) possess deficiencies in 'normal' fecal microbial composition, most likely as a result of earlier antibiotic usage. The current standard of care treatment for severe C. difficile, which consists of antibiotics, does not restore the microbiota. Restoration of the normal colonic microbiota by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may enable reversion colonic microbial population to a more 'normal'state and lead to cure.~A few patients develop severe CDAD which may be complicated by adynamic ileus, or toxic megacolon. The management in this context is based on limited data, and for some the only available option is sub-total colectomy.~Although FMT is by no means a new therapeutic modality, there is limited information on its use for the treatment of acute CDAD, including severe CDAD. Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with treatment of patients with severe CDAD, and because the evidence supporting the current recommendations is weak and based upon the demonstration that FMT is an effective strategy to re-establish a balanced intestinal microbiota with resultant cure of recurrent CDAD, we propose to study the efficacy and safety of FMT for severe CDAD.~Patients with severe CDAD can be divided into two operational groups; those that have diarrhea and those that suffer from adynamic ileus. We propose to apply FMT through colonoscopy for all patients because current data suggest that the overall success rate of FMT for recurrent CDAD with lower gastrointestinal tract FMT was higher than FMT through the upper gastrointestinal tract. In addition, for patients with adynamic ileus and toxic megacolon (i.e., the population with the highest CDAD-associated morbidity and mortality), intra-colonic FMT administration is the preferred alternative."

NIDIAG aims to develop an improved, patient-centred system for delivering primary health care in resource-constrained settings. NIDIAG will investigate three clinical syndromes, namely (i) persistent digestive disorders, (ii) persistent fever and (iii) neurological disorders, due to neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The current study focuses on persistent digestive disorders, which are defined as diarrhoea or abdominal pain that last for at least 2 weeks.~While acute diarrhoea has been studied globally, few research activities have focused on the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of long-lasting diarrhoeal episodes (2 weeks and longer) in the tropics. The spectrum of possibly involved pathogens includes more than 30 bacterial, parasitic and viral infectious agents. This lack of data may be explained by the fact that people suffering from NTDs might only seek care at a late stage of the disease. Furthermore, health systems in affected regions are often weak and their primary health-care centres are often under-staffed and lack essential diagnostic equipment.~The hypothesis of this study is that development of an evidence-based syndromic approach can lead to better diagnosis and management of NTDs in patients with persistent digestive disorders. The study will be carried out in two West African countries (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Mali) and in two Asian countries (Indonesia and Nepal). The study will follow a case-control design and patients and controls will be prospectively enrolled. In order to address the knowledge gaps, three specific objectives will be pursued. First, the contribution of NTDs to the 'persistent digestive disorders syndrome' will be assessed. Second, the value of clinical features and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the diagnosis of target NTDs that give rise to persistent digestive disorders will be determined. Third, the clinical response to standard empiric and targeted treatment of several NTDs in patients with persistent digestive disorders will be evaluated. These objectives will provide a long-term benefit for the communities by improving the clinical decision-making process for the target NTDs and thus, better diagnostic work-up and patient management can be achieved in the study countries and other similar resource-constrained countries"
