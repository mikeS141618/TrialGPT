The objective of this study is to determine if patients' degree of reported pain, stress, or anxiety is associated with receiving opiate pain medications in the emergency department or at discharge. Alert patients at least 18 years of age and who report pain greater than 3/10 are eligible to participate in the study. Consenting patients complete Visual Analog Scales describing their perceived pain, stress, and anxiety from enrollment until discharge. Demographic data and administration of pain medication is also recorded. Visual Analog Scale scores among patients who received an opioid pain medicine in the emergency department and at discharge will be compared to those who did not.",
