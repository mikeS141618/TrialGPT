Therefore, while the patient's condition involves pain, it does not align with the specific target conditions of the trial. The relevance score is low due to the lack of connection to whiplash injuries.",

Consequently, she is ineligible for the trial. The eligibility score reflects this ineligibility, being negative in relation to the relevance score.",

However, her presenting symptoms are related to her right arm and not to chronic or recurrent abdominal pain, which is the focus of the trial. Therefore, while there is some relevance due to age, the lack of relevant symptoms significantly reduces the overall relevance score.",
